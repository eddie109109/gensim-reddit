#########################################start setting up most of the packages below, you might need to install each of them one by one using pip3
# # Run in python console
import nltk; 
# nltk.download('stopwords') # if we have downloaded 'stopwords' once, we can comment out this code for the next execution

# 8. Tokenize words and Clean-up text

def sent_to_words(sentences):
    for sentence in sentences:

data_words = list(sent_to_words(titleList))

print("After cleaning up the text: ", data_words[1:2]) ## get the first list of the list of sentences
## will get the following list of the second list since the first list is just a non-changed heading: 
# [['tips', 'on', 'getting', 'job', 'as', 'python', 'developer']]


# 9. Creating Bigram and Trigram Models
# Build the bigram and trigram models
bigram = gensim.models.Phrases(data_words, min_count=5, threshold=100) # higher threshold fewer phrases.
trigram = gensim.models.Phrases(bigram[data_words], threshold=100)  

# Faster way to get a sentence clubbed as a trigram/bigram
bigram_mod = gensim.models.phrases.Phraser(bigram)
trigram_mod = gensim.models.phrases.Phraser(trigram)

# See trigram example
print("trigram example: ", trigram_mod[bigram_mod[data_words[1]]])
## will get the following list:
# ['tips', 'on', 'getting', 'job', 'as', 'python', 'developer']
